  <h3>Drawings</h3>
  <p>The second step is to have the customer gather inspiration photos that can be used in the design of the piece.</p>
  <p>We will turn the measurements, customer needs, and inspiration photos into a 3D drawing. The drawings are then emailed to the customer along with a preliminary quote. After reviewing the drawings we will discuss and implement any changes that should be made.</p>
